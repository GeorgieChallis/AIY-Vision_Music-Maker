# AIY-Vision_Music-Maker
Submission for Electromaker AIY Content

## Idea
Based around the Google AIY Vision Kit's Joy Detector, create music by changing your facial expression to play a designated note.

## Setup
* Grab yourself a Vision Kit, which comes with a Pi Zero WH, and download the latest OS Image [from Google](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/releases) - I'm using 2019-11-13.
