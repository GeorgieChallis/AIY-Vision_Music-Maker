# [Work in Progress] AIY-Vision_Music-Maker
Submission for Electromaker AIY Content

## Idea
Based around the Google AIY Vision Kit's Joy Detector, create music by changing your facial expression to play a set note in a scale.

## Setup
* Grab yourself a Vision Kit, which comes with a Pi Zero WH, and download the latest OS Image [from Google](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/releases) - I'm using 2019-11-13.
* Clone this repo or copy `music_maker.py` into the examples folder on the Pi.
* Log into the Pi via SSH and launch `music_maker.py'.
* Smile! Changing your facial expression will change the tone being played. 
* Press the top push-button to change between different scales.
